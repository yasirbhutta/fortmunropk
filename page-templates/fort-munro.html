    <p>During British rule Sir Robert Sandeman was appointed to Loilaresir which is none other than this area of Fort Munroe.
        He named Loilaresir after Colonel Munro, who was the Commissioner of Derajat Division.</p>

    <p>During that time period the natives had reservations against British. So in order to take them into confidence the British
        used to leave grocery and other food items behind when leaving for DG Khan. This shifted attitude of people for them
        and they started to respect Political Agent of British. It is also accounted that PA was carried from DG Khan through
        palki which is a vehicle-less man powered transport of that time. Now Fort Munroe is administered by Political Agent
        of Balauch Military Police who is responsible for maintaining law and order in the area. The P.A. there is also a
        commander in charge of Balauch Levis. The administrative system ensures collective responsibility there.
    </p>
    <p>The terrain there is semi arid with vegetation of shrubs and numerous pine trees. For visitors there are lodges comprising
        colonial era style rooms for playing billiards. There is also a monument whose stone plaque is inscribed with names
        of leading balauch Sardars and tribal figures to commemorate unity of their respective tribes with Pakistan. National
        flag is also hoisted there in a tall pole which also hints the presence of Political Agent there.
    </p>
    <p> There is also a British cemetery situated near political agentâ€™s house of Fort Munroe with five graves of Britishers
        who once served in administration there. There is also a beautiful Dames Lake there with all boating facilities and
        surrounded by orchards. In order to enjoy one can also dine Balauch Sajji in TDCP owned restaurant constructed side
        by Dames Lake of Fort Munroe. Due to worth seeing characteristics attributed to place the Government of Pakistan
        is now taking more initiatives to increase lodging and accommodation facilities there to support tourism industry.
